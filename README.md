# KeyboardDisplay

![Keyboard GUI](https://i.postimg.cc/8c2y9TrM/Screenshot-30.png)
Displays the pressed and unpressed keys on a keyboard.

Haven't found one much like it, so I decided to create my own.

Supports the keyboard layouts:
- QWERTY
- Colemak

If wanted, can add more support at a future date.
